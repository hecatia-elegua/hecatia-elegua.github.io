Hello! My name is hecatia elegua, which is just a mythology joke.

I'm currently working on low-level Rust code. My focus is on learning all kinds of hardware-software interaction and specifications, building tooling around this and making it easier for everyone.

I've read some of the ARM, USB, PCIe specs and am now building tools and prototyping.
