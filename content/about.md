After 5 years of learning computer science and 2 years of almost exclusively working on rust projects, I would describe myself as intermediate to advanced.

I'm not that deep into type-system wizardry (yet) and have mostly worked on low level projects.
A jack of all trades, turning into a master of one (drivers and hardware access).

I simplify systems to the best of my abilities, making them learnable and maintainable.
Reading specifications or technical books doesn't hold me back.
Several ideas on better tooling are in the works.

I am actively looking for work and would love to talk to you!
